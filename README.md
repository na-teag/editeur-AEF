# [FA Editor](https://github.com/na-teag/editeur-AEF)

This is a python project that allow you to create and manipulate finite-state automatons (FA). See below the list of available fonctionalities.

* writing and modifications of FAs
* generate a textual or graphic representation of FAs
* export and import FAs from/to json files
* test if a word can be generated by a FA
* test if a FA is complete, deterministic, emondistic or minimal
* test if two FAs are equivalent
* generate the complete, deterministic, emondistic or minial version of a FA
* generate a regex expression of a FA
* generate the complement or the mirror of a FA
* generate the product or the concatenation of two FA

# How to use the program

To execute the program, open the console and go into the src folder, and start the *main.py* file. For this, you must have python installed.
Start by checking that the version you're using is functional by starting the *tests.py* file. If you're using Windows, then type :
> python tests.py

If you're using Linux, then type the same command, or if you have python3 installed, then type
> python3 tests.py

If the tests are successful, then use the same command to start the *main.py* file.

When executing the *main.py* file, select a FA or enter one.
To enter a new FA, the syntax must be the following one :
> start_state , transition , end_state

To delete a transition, re-enter it.
After typing te FA, you will be able to use some other editing function, like delete all occurrences of a state, or rename one.

Once you finished typing the FA, to exit you must enter a void line. Then you will enter the initial and final(s) states of the FA. To delete one type it again, and to exit, enter a void line.

After that, you will see the main menu, and you'll just have to select an option.





# Functionalities details
## FA manipulation

beyond the classic operations to manipulate FAs, this program have a few practical options like renaming a state of the FA. It can also be used to fuse two states.
Another option allow you to delete all occurrences of a state without having to do it one at once.

## FA graphic representation

the **graphviz** library is used to generate an image of the FA, by generating a .dot file. The program contain a function to install the library by itself that is functional on Windows and Linux.

## Unit tests
The project contain a file named *tests.py* that execute all the functions of the program and check the result to detect any inconsistency.
